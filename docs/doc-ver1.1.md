| Length          | 4               | The size of this packet.              |
| Packet Id       | 1               | Packet Id. As same as the one in ACK. |
| Blocks          | 2               | File Blocks number. (Up to 65535)     |
| FileName length | 2               | The length of file name.              |

Create a part file for saving. It should be deleted after finishing receive.

Must return a ACK packet with same PacketID to response.
